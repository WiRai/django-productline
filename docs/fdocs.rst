``django-productline`` should be used as a base feature.

It provides the basis to create feature oriented django product lines:

- it defines the product generation process
- it provides hooks for other features to refine to add/adapt the functionality


***********************************
Refinements by example
***********************************

This section shows some use cases and patterns to develop features for a django product line.

Refining the django settings
=============================

Many features require adaptations to the settings module used by django. ``django-productline`` always uses ``django_productline.settings`` as the django settings module.
Features can apply refinements to it, to add/adapt settings to support the features functionality.
Common cases are the refinement of ``INSTALLED_APPS`` to register one or more additional django apps and the refinement of ``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` to add django middlewares.

As a simple example, we are going to create a feature called ``https_only``,
that is implemented by integrating and configuring `django-secure <http://django-secure.readthedocs.org/>`_.

First, we need to create the python package ``https_only`` by creating a folder with that name that contains an empty ``__init__.py``.
As the feature needs to refine ``django_productline.settings``, we also create a ``settings`` module within the package::

    https_only/
        __init__.py
        settings.py

Let's use the following settings refinement::

    #https_only/settings.py
    
    #add djangosecure to the end of the INSTALLED_APPS list
    def refine_INSTALLED_APPS(original):
        return original + ['djangosecure']

    #add SecurityMiddleware to the end of the MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES list
    def refine_MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES(original):
        return original + ['djangosecure.middleware.SecurityMiddleware']

    #introduce some new settings into django_productline.settings
    introduce_SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
    introduce_SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True
    introduce_SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True

This adds ``djangosecure`` to the list of installed apps and adds the middleware it depends on.
Also, it introduces some security related settings.

.. warning::

    Before using this in production, please consult the `django-secure documentation <http://django-secure.readthedocs.org/>`_.

Now, we need to make sure the settings refinement is applied, when feature ``https_only`` is bound:

To use ``https_only`` as a feature, we need to add a module called ``feature`` to it.
Let's create ``feature.py`` with the following content::

    #https_only/feature.py

    def select(composer):
        '''bind feature https_only'''
        #import settings refinement (https_only.settings)
        from . import settings
        #import project settings
        import django_productline.settings
        #apply the refinement to the project settings
        composer.compose(settings, django_productline.settings)

This applies our settings refinement, when the feature is bound.
We can now add the functionality to products by selecting the ``https_only`` feature.

Since this feature refines INSTALLED_APPS and MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES,
the composition order needs to be chosen carefully as
the web application`s behaviour is dependent on the order of their entries.


Registering urlpatterns
=========================

.. automodule:: django_productline.urls


Django Model composition
=========================

Django already provides an excellent database modularisation mechanism using apps.
An app may contain multiple models, i.e. ORM-managed database tables.
However, there is no easy way to introduce fields into existing models.

``featuremonkey`` introductions will not work because of the custom metaclass used by django models, that takes
care of additional book-keeping during construction of the model class.
As introductions are applied after the class has been constructed, the book-keeping code
is not executed in this case.

Fortunately, django provides a mechanism that takes care of the book-keeping even for
attributes that are added after the class is constructed: model fields and managers provide a ``contribute_to_class``
method.

To make use of that, ``django_productline`` extends the composer to also support another operation called ``contribute``.
It can be used just like ``introduce`` except that it does not support callable introductions.
Under the hood, it calls ``contribute_to_class`` instead of ``setattr`` which enables the introduction of fields to models.




Adding WSGI Middleware
========================

If you are using special WSGI-Middleware with your django project and would like to continue to do so using ``django-productline``,
you can directly refine ``django.core.wsgi`` to acheive that.
So if your feature is called ``mywsgifeature``, you can do it as presented in the following example:

First, create a module called ``wsgi`` in ``mywsgifeature`` containing and define a refinement for ``get_wsgi_application``::

    #mywsgifeature/wsgi.py
    
    def refine_get_wsgi_application(original):
        def get_wsgi_application():
            application = original()
            from dozer import Dozer
            return Dozer(application)
        return get_wsgi_application

This refinement will add the `Dozer <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Dozer>`_ WSGI middleware that can be used to track down memory leaks.

To use this for all products that contain ``mywsgifeature``, we need to apply the refinement in ``mywsgifeature.feature.select``::

    #mywsgifeature/feature.py

    def select(composer):
        from . import wsgi #import our refinement
        import django.core.wsgi #import base module
        #apply refinement
        composer.compose(wsgi, django.core.wsgi)

        #apply other necessary refinements of mywsgifeature


.. note::

    If multiple features of your product line add WSGI middlewares to your application, the order in which the middlewares are applied is defined by the composition order of the selected features.

Available tasks
***********************************


``manage``
=============

The ``manage`` task takes care of product generation and then simply forwards to django management commands.

So, just use::

    ape manage syncdb

where you used to do::

    python manage.py syncdb


***********************************
Required context data
***********************************

``django_productline`` requires the following keys in the product context:

**DATABASES**
    database configuration in the form required by `django.conf.settings.DATABASES <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#databases>`_.

**SITE_ID**
    ``site_id`` to be used by django. See `django.conf.settings.SITE_ID <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#site-id>`_

**DATA_DIR**
    absolute path to directory where application data will be stored.
    This directory needs to be writable by the application user.
    Data is placed in the following subfolders:
    
    - ``uploads/`` --- content uploaded by users is stored here (see `django.conf.settings.MEDIA_ROOT <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std:setting-MEDIA_ROOT>`_)
    - ``generated_static/`` --- static files created by ``manage collectstatic`` are placed here (see `django.conf.settings.STATIC_ROOT <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#static-root>`_)

**SECRET_KEY**
    see `django.conf.settings.SECRET_KEY <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/settings/#std:setting-SECRET_KEY>`_
